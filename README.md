# Team-Profile-Generator

Module 10

# Project Description

The team profile generator is a command line application that runs in Node. In order to use the application users must download all of the necessary dependencies using npm install.

# Technologies Used

This app was created using Object-Oriented Programming concepts, namely using classes and constructors to create "team member" objects based on information entered by the user. The app is run using Node.js, and uses the "Inquirer" and "FS" node modules.

This application also uses Test-Driven development through jest to perform tests on all class constructors to make sure they behave as expected.
